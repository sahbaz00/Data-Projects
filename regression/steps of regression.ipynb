    "# Whole steps of our project:\n",
    "1. **Data Collection**:\n",
    "   - Gather the relevant data from various sources such as databases, files, APIs, or web scraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Cleaning**:\n",
    "   - Handle missing or null values:\n",
    "     - Identify missing values and decide on strategies to address them (e.g., imputation, deletion).\n",
    "   - Outlier treatment:\n",
    "     - Detect and appropriately handle outliers that can skew the model's learning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Exploration**:\n",
    "   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA):\n",
    "     - Analyze the distribution of features and target variables.\n",
    "     - Visualize relationships between variables using plots (scatter plots, histograms, etc.).\n",
    "     - Identify correlations between features and the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Feature Selection/Engineering**:\n",
    "   - Identify relevant features:\n",
    "     - Select features that are most likely to have predictive power.\n",
    "   - Feature transformation:\n",
    "     - Normalize or standardize numerical features.\n",
    "     - Encode categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding, label encoding).\n",
    "     - Create new features that might enhance the model's performance (e.g., polynomial features, interaction terms).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Train-Test Split**:\n",
    "   - Split the data into training and testing sets:\n",
    "     - Reserve a portion of the data for testing the trained model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Feature Scaling**:\n",
    "   - Scale numerical features to a standard range:\n",
    "     - Use techniques like Min-Max scaling or Standardization (mean removal and variance scaling) to bring all features to a similar scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Handling Categorical Variables**:\n",
    "   - Convert categorical variables into numerical format:\n",
    "     - Use techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Addressing Data Imbalance** (if applicable):\n",
    "   - If the dataset is imbalanced (i.e., some classes are overrepresented while others are underrepresented), consider techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, or using class weights during model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Data Preprocessing Pipeline**:\n",
    "   - Build a preprocessing pipeline:\n",
    "     - Combine all preprocessing steps into a pipeline to ensure consistency when applying the same transformations to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Validation Strategy**:\n",
    "    - Choose an appropriate validation strategy:\n",
    "      - Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance robustly.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Final Data Check**:\n",
    "    - Ensure that the preprocessed data is ready for training:\n",
    "      - Verify that all features are numeric and there are no missing values."
